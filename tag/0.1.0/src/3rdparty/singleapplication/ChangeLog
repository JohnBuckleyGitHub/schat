version 0.6: 2008-07-17
	[+] The code is documented. Added doxygen project file.
	[*] SingleApplication::id() and SingleApplication::serverName() now returns 
		original values, not values that used internally.
	[*] Fixed SystemSemaphore::tryAcquire(0) under Win (calling tryAcquire() 
		with timeout 0 must behave just like calling acquire()).

	[*] Code cleanups.

version 0.5: 2008-07-04
	[+] Introduced really "one instance per user" through new public SystemSemaphore

		SystemSemaphore instead of SingleApplication.
