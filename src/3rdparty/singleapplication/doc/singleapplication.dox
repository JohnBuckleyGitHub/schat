  \mainpage SingleApplication

  \section mainpage_overview Overview

  The SingleApplication component provides support for applications that can be
  only started once per user.

  The SingleApplication class provides an crossplatform interface to detect a running
  instance, and to send command strings to that instance.

  \section mainpage_license License

  SingleApplication is distributed under the terms of the \ref license.

  \section mainpage_platforms Platforms

  SingleApplication might be usable in all environments where you find <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</a>4.\n
  SingleApplication requires Qt 4.4.x or newer.

  \section mainpage_downloads Downloads

  Stable releases are available at the SingleApplication
  <a href="http://www.qt-apps.org/content/show.php/SingleApplication?content=81163">project page</a> on <a href="http://www.qt-apps.org/">qt-apps.org</a>.

  \section mainpage_installation Installation

  Have a look at the singleapplication.pro project file. It is prepared for building
  static libraries for Win32 and Unix/X11 environments.\n
  If you don't know what to do with it, read the page \ref install and/or 
  Trolltech's <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/developer/documentation/index.html">qmake</a> documentation.
  Once you have build the library you have to install all files from the lib, include and doc directories.

  \section mainpage_using How to use the SingleApplication

  \page using Using the SingleApplication

  \section overview Overview

  For some applications it is useful or even critical that they are started only once by any user.\n 
  Future attempts to start the application should activate any already running instance, 
  and possibly perform requested actions, e.g. loading a file, in that instance.

  \section including Including in an Application

  The component can be used in three different ways:
   - together with the application as a static library;
   - as a separate shared library;
   - together with the application in source files form.

  The first option is the simplest one and it is enabled by default.\n
  You just have to add <tt>singleapplication.pri</tt> to your project file, include <tt>singleapplication.h</tt> and create the SingleApplication object just after creating the Q(Core)Application object.

  To use shared library, just uncomment <tt>SINGLEAPPLICATION_LIBCONFIG = dll</tt> in <tt>config.pri</tt> and rebuild project as described above.\n
  Refer to the Qt documentation for more details about using libraries if You have some questions.

  If you do not want to use the SingleApplication as a library at all, make sure You comment <tt>SINGLEAPPLICATION_LIBCONFIG = dll</tt> in <tt>config.pri</tt> and rebuild project as described above.\n
  Also define the @c SINGLEAPPLICATION_EXPORT macro (by adding it to the @c DEFINES variable in your project file).
